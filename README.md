# Forecasting-Stock-Price-Direction
## Objective: Forecast the daily price direction of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) stock. Navigating the stock market's complexities and volatility can be challenging. To achieve profitability, it's not necessary to predict the exact price; instead, it's crucial to anticipate the price direction, whether it will rise or fall compared to the current price. If the prediction indicates an increase, it could be advantageous to purchase stocks; otherwise, selling may be the better option. Consequently, the goal is to create a binary classification model that determines if the next day's closing price will be higher than the opening price.
